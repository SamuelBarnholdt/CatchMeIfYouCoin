# CatchMeIfYouCoin

CatchMeIfYouCoin terminal blockchain application.

To run the CatchMeIfYouCoin application, use your Haskell compiler of choice. If you use The Glascow Haskell Compiler, run the program with ghci interface.hs . Type main in the terminal to use the application. To add pendingtransactions exit from the main application and write miner in the terminal.

When this is done, copy this ledger: [Block 0 0 [VerifiedTransaction 0 [((0,0),yourgenesisamounthere,0,0,0)] [(yourpubkeyhere,yourgenesisamounthere,0,0,0)]]] , and add it to ledger.txt . You will find your pubkey in accounts.txt after creating an account in interface(the format is [(name,password),(privatekey,pubkey->(pub,pub))]. When the ledger is created, it's time to start making transactions!
