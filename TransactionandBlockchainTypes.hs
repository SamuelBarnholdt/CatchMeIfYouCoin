{- Ledger
   Description - The blockchain.
   Invariant   - The net of all inputs must be equal to the net of all outputs.
                 The Index of all blocks has to be correct according to the spot in the
                 list and, the hash must be the hash of the previous block.
-}
type Ledger = [Block]

{- Block
   Description - Block containing all transactions that have been made. Index represents
                 the place in the ledger, hash is the hash of the previousblock, and
                 verifiedtransactions is the list of all transactions in that block.
   Invariant   - None

{- UnverifiedBlock
   Description  - Block with transactions, waiting to be verified in the ledger.
   Invariant    - None

data UnverifiedBlock = UBlock Transactions deriving (Show,Read)

{- VerifiedTransaction
   Description  - Verified transaction. TransactionID represents the index in
                  the transactionlist in the block.

   Invariant    - For a transaction to be verified it's inputs must be found as
                  outputs in the ledger, and the net of all outputs can't be higher
                  than the inputs.

   Description  - List of transactions.

   Description  - List of verified transactions.

{- UTXO
   ("UTXO is geek-speak for â€œunspent transaction output."")
   Description  - List of all "unused" output, meaning they haven't been used
                  as input in the corresponding video.
   Invariant    - None
